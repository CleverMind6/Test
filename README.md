This is one of the first mock tests I've written as a tutor for one of my students. This is a grade 12 advanced functions mock test.

By rereading the mock test, it seems I have made this about 2 hours worth of work. 

Everything the student studied in the unit was on the test.
- Intervals
- Odd and Even functions
- Domain and range of functions.
- Parent functions of the following:
	- Constant and Linear
	- Quadratics
	- Cubics
	- Absolute Value
- Inverse relations
- Transformations

Since it was a while going over these topics, this mock test used the word "base function" to refer to parent functions.
